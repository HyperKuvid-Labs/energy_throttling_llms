# Energy-Based Token Throttling for LLMs with RLHF
Develop an energy-aware DDPG reinforcement learning framework that dynamically controls speculative decoding parameters to maintain energy utilization within a tight 95-98% range. The system continuously monitors comprehensive hardware metrics including CPU core temperatures, GPU temperatures, fan speeds, and remaining battery charge to create a real-time hardware state vector. The architecture consists of three neural networks: a Fast Actor that takes normalized hardware states as input and outputs three speculative decoding parameters (speculative_num_steps, speculative_eagle_topk, speculative_num_draft_tokens), a Target Actor that provides training stability through soft updates (τ = 0.001), and a Q-Critic that performs function approximation by taking concatenated [hardware_state, speculative_params] as input to learn Q(s,a) through temporal difference learning. The reward function normalizes each hardware metric against established baselines, clips values to [0,1], and averages them for unified feedback. When energy levels approach 98%, the system learns to reduce speculative parameters to prevent thermal throttling. When energy drops below 95%, it increases parallel generation to maximize resource utilization. The TD learning update occurs every two iterations using Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[reward + γ * max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)], where the critic learns from immediate normalized rewards and target actor Q-value estimates. This creates a dynamic optimization environment where the model learns to self-regulate computational intensity, discovering the optimal energy-performance sweet spot that maximizes inference throughput without causing system instability, crashes, or thermal damage on resource-constrained hardware.
