# Energy-Based Token Throttling for LLMs with RLHF
Develop an energy-aware reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using RLHF with dual reward signals: traditional optimum rewards for model quality and energy-based rewards for hardware efficiency.

For more details on the idea that we're trying to achieve visit -> [_**Energy-Based Token Throttling for LLMs with RLHF**_](https://www.pradheep.dev/ideas/idea-1)

Would love to contribute and get the correct guidance.
